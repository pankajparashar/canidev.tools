			"1. In Developer Tools, open **Info > Meta**. Scroll down to the **Social media previews** section to see cards for each social media website like X, Facebook, LinkedIn etc.",
			"2. This also works with `localhost` while running the app locally. Use the **Overwrite domain** button to preview the card with production URL.",
			"3. Toggle the **light/dark** buttons to preview the card in the light and the dark mode respectively."
