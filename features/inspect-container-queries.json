    "Notes": "1. Every element defined as a query container has a `container` badge next to it in the **Elements** panel. The badge toggles a dotted-line overlay of the container and its descendants.\n2. To find and select a container element that caused the query to take effect, hover over and click the element name above the `@container` declaration. \n3. When hovered over, the name turns into a link to the element in the **Elements** panel and the **Styles** pane displays the queried property and its current value.\n",
